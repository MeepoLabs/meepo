# Week 10 (Oct 6 â€“ Oct 12 2025): Agent Orchestration & Cost Tracking

## Overview
Complete Phase 2 by implementing advanced agent orchestration, multi-step planning, and comprehensive cost optimization features.

## Tasks
### Advanced Orchestration
- [ ] Add `PlanTool` that lets agent break down complex tasks
- [ ] Implement parallel tool execution where safe (asyncio.gather)
- [ ] Multi-agent workflow coordination
- [ ] Task dependency management and execution order
- [ ] Conditional execution logic based on tool results

### Cost Tracking & Optimization
- [ ] Cost tracker: persist total tokens & $ per invocation
- [ ] Real-time cost monitoring during execution
- [ ] Cost-based provider routing (OpenAI vs Claude vs Gemini)
- [ ] Usage budgets and alerts per user
- [ ] Cost optimization recommendations

### Reliability & Failover
- [ ] Failover logic: retry on provider error up to N times
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for unreliable providers
- [ ] Graceful degradation when services are down
- [ ] Execution timeout and resource limits
- [ ] Error recovery and continuation strategies

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Batch processing for similar requests
- [ ] Connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Memory management for long-running agents
- [ ] Database query optimization

### Frontend Enhancements
- [ ] Visualize tool chain execution timeline
- [ ] Show cost breakdown per chat session
- [ ] Real-time execution progress tracking
- [ ] Agent performance analytics dashboard
- [ ] Cost trends and usage patterns

### SDK & Developer Experience
- [ ] Auto-generate typed Python & JS clients from OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Publish `meepo-cli` (Python Click) with `ingest` and `ask` commands
- [ ] Agent configuration templates and examples
- [ ] Developer debugging tools and logs
- [ ] Performance profiling utilities

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Stress test parallel tool execution with 100 invocations
- [ ] Scenario tests for failover and error conditions
- [ ] Cost tracking accuracy validation
- [ ] Performance regression testing
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent agent executions

## Deliverables
- Advanced multi-step agent orchestration
- Comprehensive cost tracking and optimization
- Reliable failover and error handling
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Developer tools and SDK

## Next Steps
Buffer Week 11 for Phase 2 testing, bug fixes, and integration validation.

## Notes
This week completes the core agent system:
- Orchestration enables complex multi-step workflows
- Cost tracking provides transparency and control
- Reliability ensures production-ready operation
- Performance optimization scales with usage
