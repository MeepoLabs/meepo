# Week 08 (Sep 22 â€“ Sep 28 2025): Streaming & Secret Management

## Overview
Add streaming support for real-time agent responses and implement secure secret management for user API keys. Build on the LLM integration from Week 7.

## Tasks
### Streaming Implementation
- [ ] Add Server-Sent Events (SSE) support to agent endpoints
- [ ] Implement streaming for `/agents/{id}/invoke` endpoint
- [ ] Add WebSocket support for real-time chat
- [ ] Handle streaming errors and connection management
- [ ] Implement streaming rate limiting and backpressure

### Secret Management System
- [ ] Design encrypted storage for per-user API keys (AES-GCM in Postgres)
- [ ] Implement CRUD endpoints `/secrets` with RBAC checks
- [ ] Add secret rotation and expiration policies
- [ ] Secure key derivation and encryption at rest
- [ ] Implement secret audit logging

### Frontend Streaming
- [ ] Live stream responses in chat view
- [ ] Add typing indicators and loading states
- [ ] Handle streaming connection errors gracefully
- [ ] Implement streaming response caching
- [ ] Add streaming progress indicators

### Secret Management UI
- [ ] "Secrets" settings page (add/edit/delete keys)
- [ ] Secure input forms with validation
- [ ] API key masking and reveal functionality
- [ ] Secret usage analytics and monitoring
- [ ] Integration guides for different providers

### Security & Performance
- [ ] Rate limiting for streaming endpoints
- [ ] Memory management for long-running streams
- [ ] Connection cleanup and resource management
- [ ] Streaming authentication and authorization
- [ ] Performance monitoring for streaming operations

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for secret encryption/decryption
- [ ] Integration tests for streaming endpoints
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent streaming connections
- [ ] Security tests for secret management
- [ ] Browser compatibility tests for SSE/WebSocket

## Deliverables
- Streaming support for agent responses
- Secure secret management system
- Real-time chat interface foundations
- Secret management UI

## Next Steps
Week 09 will add guardrails and content moderation systems.

## Notes
This week focuses on real-time user experience and security:
- Streaming enables responsive agent interactions
- Secret management allows users to securely use their own API keys
- Foundation for advanced chat features in Phase 3
