# Week 1: Project Setup and Core Architecture (March 1-7, 2025)

## Overview
The first week focuses on setting up the project structure, defining core interfaces, and implementing the basic agent architecture. This will establish the foundation for the entire SDK.

## Tasks

### Project Setup
- [x] Create requirements document
- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Set up development environment
  - [x] Create Python package structure
  - [x] Set up Poetry for dependency management
  - [x] Configure Ruff for linting and formatting
  - [x] Set up pytest for testing
- [x] Create initial documentation structure
  - [x] Set up Sphinx for API documentation
  - [x] Create basic usage guides

### Core Interfaces
- [ ] Define base Agent interface

  - [ ] Create type definitions
- [ ] Define Provider interface
  - [ ] Design common interface for LLM providers
  - [ ] Define methods for text generation, embeddings, etc.
  - [ ] Create provider configuration system

### Basic Agent Types

  - [ ] Create adapter for Anthropic API
  - [ ] Implement streaming support
  - [ ] Add tool use capabilities
- [ ] Implement LiteLLM integration (optional)
  - [ ] Create adapter for LiteLLM
  - [ ] Test with multiple providers

### Basic Tool Framework
- [ ] Define Tool interface

  - [ ] Create utility tools (calculator, web search, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement tool registration system
  - [ ] Add tool selection logic

### Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for core components
  - [ ] Test Agent interface
  - [ ] Test Provider interface
  - [ ] Test basic tools
- [ ] Create example scripts
  - [ ] Simple agent example
  - [ ] Multi-agent collaboration example
- [ ] Update documentation
  - [ ] Document core interfaces
  - [ ] Create getting started guide
  - [ ] Plan for Week 2

## Deliverables
- Functional Python package structure with core interfaces
- Basic implementation of Agent and Provider interfaces
- Initial implementation of Supervisor and Worker agents
- Integration with at least two LLM providers
- Basic tool framework
- Unit tests for core components
- Initial documentation and examples

## Next Steps
- Implement Observer, Planning, and Validation agents
- Enhance memory and context management
- Develop more sophisticated tool integration
- Begin work on the server layer for cross-language support
