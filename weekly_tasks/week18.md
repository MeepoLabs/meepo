# Week 18 (Dec 1 â€“ Dec 7 2025): Security Hardening & Performance

## Overview
Implement comprehensive security measures and optimize performance for production deployment. Focus on protection against common attacks and performance bottlenecks.

## Tasks
### Security Hardening
- [ ] Full penetration testing using OWASP ZAP against staging
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Add security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- [ ] Configure CORS policies for production domains
- [ ] Implement request size limits and timeout protections
- [ ] Add SQL injection prevention measures
- [ ] Implement XSS protection for user inputs

### Secrets & Encryption
- [ ] Implement secret scanning in CI with `gitleaks`
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest (API keys, user data)
- [ ] Implement proper key rotation strategies
- [ ] Add environment variable validation
- [ ] Secure API key storage with encryption
- [ ] Implement secure session management

### Authentication Security
- [ ] Add account lockout protection (failed login attempts)
- [ ] Implement password strength requirements
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication (2FA) support
- [ ] Implement session timeout and logout
- [ ] Add suspicious login detection
- [ ] Secure password reset flows

### API Security
- [ ] Implement JWT token validation and expiration
- [ ] Add API rate limiting per user and endpoint
- [ ] Implement request signature validation
- [ ] Add API versioning and deprecation handling
- [ ] Secure file upload validation and scanning
- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 security best practices

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Database query optimization and indexing
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data:
  - [ ] User session data
  - [ ] Agent configurations
  - [ ] Retrieval results (short-term)
  - [ ] LLM provider responses
- [ ] Add database connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Implement async/await for I/O operations

### Frontend Performance
- [ ] Profile SvelteKit bundle size and optimize
- [ ] Enable code-splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Implement service worker for caching
- [ ] Optimize images and static assets
- [ ] Add CDN configuration for static files
- [ ] Minimize JavaScript and CSS bundles

### Load Testing & Benchmarking
- [ ] Benchmark backend concurrency with `wrk` (target p95 < 750ms)
- [ ] Load test with realistic user scenarios:
  - [ ] 100 concurrent users
  - [ ] Agent execution under load
  - [ ] Data ingestion pipeline stress test
  - [ ] Chat UI responsiveness
- [ ] Performance regression testing in CI
- [ ] Memory and CPU usage optimization

### Monitoring Security
- [ ] Implement security event logging
- [ ] Add intrusion detection alerting
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious API usage patterns
- [ ] Track failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Alert on unusual resource consumption

### Compliance Preparation
- [ ] Data retention policy implementation
- [ ] User data export/deletion capabilities (GDPR)
- [ ] Audit logging for compliance requirements
- [ ] Privacy policy technical implementation
- [ ] Data processing consent management

### Testing
- [ ] Security regression testing suite
- [ ] Performance benchmark automation
- [ ] Stress testing with error injection
- [ ] Security header validation tests

## Deliverables
- Hardened security posture with comprehensive protection
- Optimized performance meeting production targets
- Load testing results and benchmarks
- Security compliance framework

## Next Steps
Week 19 will focus on infrastructure automation and deployment pipelines.

## Notes
This week transforms the platform from development-ready to production-secure:
- Security hardening protects against real-world attacks
- Performance optimization ensures good user experience
- Load testing validates scalability assumptions
- Compliance preparation enables enterprise adoption
