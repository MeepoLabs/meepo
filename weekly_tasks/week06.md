# Week 06 (Sep 8 â€“ Sep 14 2025): Authentication & Agent Foundations

## Overview
Implement robust authentication system and create the core agent abstraction. Focus on security and solid foundations before adding LLM complexity.

## Tasks
### Authentication System
- [ ] Implement Supabase JWT authentication middleware
- [ ] Create user registration and login endpoints
- [ ] Add role-based access control (RBAC) foundations
- [ ] Implement session management and token refresh
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Create user profile management endpoints

### Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Add user-related tables and foreign keys
- [ ] Update existing tables with proper user ownership
- [ ] Add indexes for user-based queries
- [ ] Implement soft deletes for user data

### Agent System Foundation
- [ ] Define agent schema (name, system_prompt, tools, config, user_id)
- [ ] Implement `agents` CRUD endpoints (FastAPI `APIRouter`)
- [ ] Add agent ownership and access control
- [ ] Create base `Tool` dataclass and registration system
- [ ] Implement basic tool discovery and validation

### Basic Agent Operations
- [ ] Add `POST /agents/{id}/invoke` for single-turn chat (basic implementation)
- [ ] Implement simple prompt templating system
- [ ] Add agent configuration validation
- [ ] Create agent execution logging framework

### Frontend Foundation
- [ ] Implement login/signup forms with Supabase auth
- [ ] Add protected route middleware
- [ ] Create user dashboard layout
- [ ] Add "Create Agent" form (basic version)
- [ ] Implement agent list and basic management

### Security
- [ ] Add request rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Implement basic input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add security headers (CORS, CSP basics)
- [ ] Create audit logging for auth events

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for authentication middleware
- [ ] Integration tests for agent CRUD operations
- [ ] Security tests for auth bypass attempts
- [ ] Contract tests for API schema

## Deliverables
- Complete authentication system with Supabase
- Agent data model and basic CRUD operations
- Secure user dashboard with agent management
- Foundation for LLM integration in Week 7

## Next Steps
Week 07 will add multi-provider LLM integration and the tool system.

## Notes
**Removed from original Week 6:**
- Multi-provider LLM integration (moved to Week 7)
- Secret vault implementation (moved to Week 8)
- Streaming support (moved to Week 8)
- Complex tool integrations (moved to Week 7)

This allows focus on authentication security and solid agent foundations.
