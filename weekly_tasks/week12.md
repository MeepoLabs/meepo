# Week 12 (Oct 20 â€“ Oct 26 2025): Output Integrations Foundation

## Overview
Start Phase 3 by building the foundation for output integrations, allowing agent results to be sent to external systems like social media, publishing platforms, and webhooks.

## Tasks
### Output Task Architecture
- [ ] Design abstract `OutputTask` base class
- [ ] Implement task queue system for async execution
- [ ] Create task status tracking and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Add task scheduling and batching capabilities
- [ ] Implement task result storage and logging

### Core Integration Types
- [ ] Implement `TwitterThreadTask` for posting threads
- [ ] Implement `WordPressPostTask` for creating draft posts
- [ ] Implement generic `HttpPostTask` with templated payloads
- [ ] Add `SlackWebhookTask` for team notifications
- [ ] Create `DiscordWebhookTask` for community updates

### Authentication Framework
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 integration framework
- [ ] Token storage and refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Per-user credential management
- [ ] Authentication flow UI components
- [ ] Secure credential encryption and storage

### Task Management Backend
- [ ] REST API for output task CRUD operations
- [ ] Task execution engine with worker processes
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Rate limiting per integration type
- [ ] Task dependency and scheduling system

### Frontend Foundation
- [ ] Output task creation wizard UI
- [ ] Integration connection management page
- [ ] Task status monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Output preview and validation
- [ ] Template management for common outputs

### Configuration & Templates
- [ ] Configurable output templates
- [ ] Dynamic field mapping and transformation
- [ ] Conditional output logic
- [ ] Output format validation
- [ ] Template sharing and marketplace foundation

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Mock integration testing framework
- [ ] Unit tests for all output task types
- [ ] Authentication flow testing
- [ ] Template validation testing
- [ ] Error scenario testing

## Deliverables
- Output task architecture and framework
- Core integration implementations
- Authentication and credential management
- Task management UI and APIs
- Testing infrastructure for integrations

## Next Steps
Week 13 will add OAuth flows and external API integrations.

## Notes
This week establishes the foundation for external integrations:
- Abstract architecture supports multiple integration types
- OAuth framework enables secure third-party connections
- Task queue ensures reliable async execution
- UI framework supports user-friendly configuration
