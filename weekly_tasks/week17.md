# Week 17 (Nov 24 â€“ Nov 30 2025): Observability & Monitoring

## Overview
Implement comprehensive observability stack with structured logging, metrics, tracing, and monitoring dashboards for production readiness.

## Tasks
### Structured Logging
- [ ] Implement `structlog` configuration with JSON output
- [ ] Add correlation IDs for request tracing
- [ ] Configure log levels and filtering
- [ ] Add structured logging to all major operations:
  - [ ] Agent executions with prompt/response/cost
  - [ ] Data ingestion pipeline stages
  - [ ] Authentication events
  - [ ] API request/response cycles
  - [ ] Background job processing
- [ ] Set up log rotation and retention policies

### Metrics Collection
- [ ] Implement Prometheus metrics exposition at `/metrics`
- [ ] Add custom metrics for:
  - [ ] API request duration and count by endpoint
  - [ ] Agent execution latency and success rate
  - [ ] Data ingestion throughput and queue depth
  - [ ] LLM API call costs and token usage
  - [ ] User authentication success/failure rates
  - [ ] Background job processing times
- [ ] Add health check metrics and uptime tracking

### Distributed Tracing
- [ ] Set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- [ ] Configure trace export to Grafana Tempo or Jaeger
- [ ] Add custom spans for:
  - [ ] End-to-end agent execution flow
  - [ ] Data ingestion pipeline stages
  - [ ] External API calls (LLM providers, OAuth)
  - [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Implement trace sampling for production load

### Monitoring Dashboards
- [ ] Set up Grafana Cloud or self-hosted Grafana
- [ ] Create dashboard for system health:
  - [ ] API response times and error rates
  - [ ] Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
  - [ ] Database connection pool metrics
  - [ ] Queue depth and processing rates
- [ ] Create business metrics dashboard:
  - [ ] User registrations and daily active users
  - [ ] Agent executions per day/hour
  - [ ] Cost tracking (LLM API spend)
  - [ ] Data ingestion volume

### Alerting
- [ ] Configure alert rules for:
  - [ ] API error rate > 5%
  - [ ] Response time p95 > 2 seconds
  - [ ] Queue depth > 1000 jobs
  - [ ] Database connection failures
  - [ ] High LLM API costs
- [ ] Set up notification channels (Slack, email, PagerDuty)
- [ ] Implement escalation policies

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Add application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Track slow database queries
- [ ] Monitor memory leaks and resource usage
- [ ] Profile CPU-intensive operations
- [ ] Add performance regression detection

### Testing
- [ ] Load test monitoring stack with simulated traffic
- [ ] Verify alert firing and recovery
- [ ] Test dashboard responsiveness under load
- [ ] Validate trace collection completeness

## Deliverables
- Complete observability stack (logs, metrics, traces)
- Production-ready monitoring dashboards
- Automated alerting system
- Performance monitoring and profiling

## Next Steps
Week 18 will focus on security hardening and performance optimization.

## Notes
This week is critical for production operations and debugging. The observability foundation enables:
- Quick incident response and debugging
- Performance optimization based on real data
- Business intelligence for product decisions
- Proactive alerting before user impact
