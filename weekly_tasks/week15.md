# Week 15 (Nov 10 â€“ Nov 16 2025): Embeddable Widget & SDKs

## Overview
Create embeddable chat widget for external websites and develop comprehensive SDKs for programmatic platform interaction.

## Tasks
### Embeddable Widget Development
- [ ] Lightweight JavaScript widget for external sites

- [ ] Custom styling and theming options
- [ ] Widget configuration and initialization
- [ ] Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Widget Integration & Authentication
- [ ] Signed JWT endpoint for widget end-user auth (`/widget/auth`)
- [ ] Magic link authentication for widget users
- [ ] Anonymous user support with session tracking
- [ ] Developer authentication key management
- [ ] Widget usage analytics and tracking

### Widget Customization
- [ ] Generate embeddable `<script>` snippet with configuration
- [ ] Custom branding and color schemes
- [ ] Configurable widget behavior and features
- [ ] Multiple widget variants (floating, inline, modal)
- [ ] Widget A/B testing framework

### Python SDK Development
- [ ] Comprehensive Python SDK for platform API
- [ ] Client authentication and session management
- [ ] Agent management and execution methods
- [ ] Data ingestion and retrieval functions
- [ ] Usage monitoring and analytics access

### JavaScript SDK Development
- [ ] Browser and Node.js compatible JavaScript SDK
- [ ] TypeScript definitions and type safety
- [ ] Real-time chat integration methods
- [ ] Widget embedding helper functions
- [ ] Event handling and callback system

### CLI Tools
