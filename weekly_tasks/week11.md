# Week 11 (Oct 13 – Oct 19 2025): Buffer B – Phase 2 Testing & Fixes

## Overview
Dedicated buffer week for stabilizing Phase 2 agent system, fixing critical bugs, and ensuring production readiness before moving to integrations.

## Tasks
### Bug Triage & Resolution
- [ ] Review open GitHub issues labeled `bug` and `agent-system`
- [ ] Prioritize and fix critical defects impacting agent runs
- [ ] Address streaming and WebSocket connection issues
- [ ] Fix secret management and encryption bugs
- [ ] Resolve guardrails and moderation edge cases

### Code Quality & Refactoring
- [ ] Extract common tool utilities into `core/tools/utils.py`
- [ ] Simplify data models (Pydantic v2) & remove duplication
- [ ] Optimize database queries and connection handling
- [ ] Improve error handling and logging consistency
- [ ] Code review and security audit of Phase 2 features

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Increase unit test coverage to ≥ 80% for agent system
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete agent workflows
- [ ] Performance testing for concurrent agent executions
- [ ] Security testing for authentication and secrets
- [ ] End-to-end testing of streaming and moderation

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Add VS Code snippets for common agent patterns
- [ ] Improve CLI (`make`) commands for development
- [ ] Update developer documentation for agent system
- [ ] Create debugging guides and troubleshooting docs
- [ ] Enhance local development setup scripts

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Set up basic Prometheus metrics for agent operations
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for agent performance
- [ ] Implement health checks for all services
- [ ] Add structured logging for agent executions
- [ ] Monitor cost tracking accuracy and performance

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile agent execution bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize streaming response times
- [ ] Improve secret management query performance
- [ ] Reduce memory usage in long-running operations
- [ ] Database indexing optimization

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update agent orchestration docs with new features
- [ ] Document streaming implementation and best practices
- [ ] Create secret management user guides
- [ ] Update API documentation and examples
- [ ] Record demo videos for agent features

## Deliverables
- Stable agent system with resolved critical bugs
- Improved code quality and test coverage
- Enhanced monitoring and observability
- Updated documentation and developer tools
- Performance optimizations implemented

## Next Steps
Phase 3 begins with output integrations foundation in Week 12.

## Notes
This buffer week is critical for Phase 2 stability:
- Bug fixes ensure reliable agent operation
- Refactoring improves maintainability for Phase 3
- Testing validates production readiness
- Monitoring provides operational visibility
