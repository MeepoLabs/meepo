## **Phase Breakdown:**

### **Phase 1 – Foundation & RAG (Weeks 1-4)**
- Project setup, database design, basic ingestion
- Data loaders, background processing, retrieval pipeline
- **4 weeks** (was 3) - more realistic for foundation work

### **Phase 2 – Agent System (Weeks 6-10)**
- Authentication, agent foundations, LLM integration
- Streaming, security, orchestration, cost tracking
- **5 weeks** (was 4) - better distribution of complex features

### **Phase 3 – Integrations & UI (Weeks 12-15)**
- Output integrations, OAuth, chat UI, embeddable widgets
- **4 weeks** (same) - but better task distribution

### **Phase 4 – Production Ready (Weeks 17-21)**
- Observability, security, infrastructure, deployment
- **5 weeks** (was 2) - critical for production readiness

### **Strategic Buffers:**
- **Week 5**: Phase 1 stabilization
- **Week 11**: Phase 2 testing & integration fixes
- **Week 16**: Phase 3 integration testing & UI polish
- **Week 22**: Post-launch feedback & iteration
