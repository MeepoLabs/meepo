# Meepo SDK Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Meepo is an SDK designed to build intelligent agents across multiple programming languages. It provides a flexible, extensible framework for creating, deploying, and orchestrating agents that can leverage various LLM providers.

### 1.2 Vision
Enable users to build sophisticated agent systems in any programming language, starting with Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, with plans to expand to Go, Dart, and other languages in the future.

### 1.3 Target Users
- AI/ML engineers

- Researchers
- Businesses looking to integrate AI agents into their applications

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1 Design Philosophy
- **Async-first**: Designed for asynchronous operations with synchronous wrappers
- **Modular**: Composed of interchangeable components
- **Extensible**: Easy to extend with new agent types, providers, and tools
- **Cross-language**: Consistent API across different programming languages
- **Scalable**: Capable of handling complex agent hierarchies and large-scale deployments

### 2.2 Implementation Strategy
1. Develop a comprehensive Python SDK as the core implementation
2. Build a server layer on top of the Python SDK
3. Create thin client libraries for other languages (JS/TS, Go, Dart, etc.)
4. Ensure consistent API and behavior across all implementations
