# Meepo Platform Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Meepo consists of three core components:
1. pymeepo - A universal Python SDK for integrating agents from any framework
2. Meepo Cloud - A managed platform for agent workflow orchestration
3. Language SDKs - Native libraries for interacting with Meepo Cloud

### 1.2 Vision
Create a comprehensive ecosystem where pymeepo serves as the universal integration layer, Meepo Cloud provides enterprise-grade orchestration, and language-specific SDKs enable native platform interaction.

### 1.3 Target Users
- Framework Developers: Using pymeepo to make their frameworks Meepo-compatible
- AI/ML Engineers: Using pymeepo to integrate various agent frameworks
- Enterprise Developers: Using language SDKs to interact with Meepo Cloud
- System Architects: Designing agent workflows on Meepo Cloud
- Business Users: Creating workflows through the visual interface

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1 Design Philosophy
- **Universal Integration**: pymeepo as the foundation for framework integration
- **Cloud-First**: Meepo Cloud as the central orchestration platform
- **Native Experience**: Language-specific SDKs for natural platform interaction
- **Enterprise Ready**: Built for production deployment and scaling
- **Developer Friendly**: Comprehensive SDKs and tools for all major languages

### 2.2 Implementation Strategy
1. Develop pymeepo as the universal integration SDK
2. Build Meepo Cloud as the central platform
3. Create language-specific SDKs for platform interaction
4. Implement enterprise management features
