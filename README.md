# Meepo SDK

Meepo is a powerful SDK for building intelligent agents across multiple programming languages. It provides a flexible, extensible framework for creating, deploying, and orchestrating agents that can leverage various LLM providers.

## Overview

The Meepo SDK enables developers to:

- Build a robust Python SDK with comprehensive agent capabilities
- Access the same functionality in JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart, Go, and other languages via a hosted gateway
- Create sophisticated hierarchical agent structures for complex multi-agent scenarios
- Seamlessly integrate with existing frameworks like LangChain and SmoLAgents
- Leverage multiple LLM providers with unified interfaces and streaming capabilities

## Project Planning

We follow a weekly development cycle with clearly defined tasks and deliverables:

- [Project Timeline Overview](weekly_tasks/project_timeline.md) - Complete 8-week development plan
- [Week 1 (March 1-7, 2025)](weekly_tasks/week1.md) - Project Setup and Core Architecture
- [Week 2 (March 8-14, 2025)](weekly_tasks/week2.md) - Advanced Agents and Memory Management
- [Week 3 (March 15-21, 2025)](weekly_tasks/week3.md) - Server Layer and Cross-Language Support
- [Week 4 (March 22-28, 2025)](weekly_tasks/week4.md) - JavaScript/TypeScript Client and Advanced Memory
- [Week 5 (March 29 - April 4, 2025)](weekly_tasks/week5.md) - Hosted Gateway and Advanced Tool Integration
- [Week 6 (April 5-11, 2025)](weekly_tasks/week6.md) - Additional Language Clients and Advanced Collaboration
- [Week 7 (April 12-18, 2025)](weekly_tasks/week7.md) - Demo Applications, Analytics, and Developer Tools
- [Week 8 (April 19-25, 2025)](weekly_tasks/week8.md) - Beta Release, Feedback, and Production Preparation

## Core Features
### Python-First Development

The core SDK is built in Python with:
- Async-first design with synchronous wrappers
- Comprehensive type hints and documentation
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Robust testing and examples

### Multi-Language Support via Gateway

Access Meepo's capabilities from any language:
- Python SDK for direct integration
- HTTP/WebSocket gateway for other languages
- Thin client libraries for JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart, Go, and more
- Consistent API experience across all languages

### Hierarchical Agent Architecture

Build complex multi-agent systems:
- Supervisor agents that orchestrate and manage other agents
- Worker agents that perform specialized tasks
- Planning agents that break down complex problems
- Validation agents that ensure quality and correctness
- Observer agents that monitor and provide feedback

### Interoperability

Integrate with your existing tools:
- Compatible with LangChain components and agents
- Interoperable with SmoLAgents and other frameworks
- Import/export capabilities for agent definitions
- Bridge adapters for seamless integration

### LLM Provider Integration

Connect to any LLM provider:
- Built-in support for OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini
- Integration with LiteLLM for expanded provider support
- Custom provider implementations for specialized needs
- Fallback strategies and cost optimization
