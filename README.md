# Meepo Platform

Meepo is a universal platform for integrating, managing, and orchestrating AI agents across different frameworks and providers. Our platform consists of three key components:

1. **pymeepo**: A universal Python SDK for integrating agents from any framework (LangChain, AutoGen, etc.)
2. **Meepo Cloud**: A managed platform for deploying, orchestrating, and monitoring agent workflows
3. **Language SDKs**: Native SDKs in multiple languages for interacting with Meepo Cloud

## Core Features

- **Universal Integration (pymeepo)**: One SDK to integrate and orchestrate agents from any framework
- **Cloud Platform**: Deploy, manage, and monitor agent workflows at scale
- **Multi-Language Support**: Native SDKs for Python, TypeScript, Go, and more
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Create complex agent workflows through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **Enterprise Management**: Comprehensive tools for deployment, monitoring, and scaling
- **Marketplace**: Share and discover pre-built workflows, tools, and integrations
